At 1,0, because the Y coordinate is 0, the geologic index is 1 * 16807 = 16807. The erosion level is (16807 + 510) % 20183 = 17317. The type is 17317 % 3 = 1, wet.
At 0,1, because the X coordinate is 0, the geologic index is 1 * 48271 = 48271. The erosion level is (48271 + 510) % 20183 = 8415. The type is 8415 % 3 = 0, rocky.
At 1,1, neither coordinate is 0 and it is not the coordinate of the target, so the geologic index is the erosion level of 0,1 (8415) times the erosion level of 1,0 (17317), 8415 * 17317 = 145722555. The erosion level is (145722555 + 510) % 20183 = 1805. The type is 1805 % 3 = 2, narrow.
